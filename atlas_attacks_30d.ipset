# [ATLAS Attacks] (https://atlas.arbor.net/summary/attacks) - 
# ATLAS uses lightweight honeypot sensors to detect and 
# fingerprint the attacks launched by malicious sources on 
# the Internet. In most cases the attacker is trying to take 
# control of the target via a published exploit for a known 
# vulnerability. A variety of exploit tools exist and are 
# usually written specifically for each attack vector. 
# Exploit attempts and attacks are most often launched from 
# bots (hosts under an attacker's control), which will 
# automatically try to exploit any possible host on the 
# Internet. Attack origins are usually not spoofed, although 
# the source host may be compromised or infected with malware.
